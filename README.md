# SmartAdBlock
SmartAdBlock project

Note to readers: Since the beginning smartadblock code was available to everyone unobfuscated and easy to read as (some people seem to ignore that) any browser extension can be read.
But here you go, open source github enjoy!

The V1.1.1 for firefox has no script execution as mozilla team requires all injected script to be included (request received on 4th March). This is an urgent quick fix to keep smartadblock available on the mozilla store until we develop a better method for firefox.

Update log

1.1.1
(only firefox) removed script injection to comply with firefox add on review requirements. In the v1.1.2 the injected scripts will be included in the package to comply with the request.
